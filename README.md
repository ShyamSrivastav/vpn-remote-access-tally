Secure remote access infrastructure using OpenVPN, SMB, and Tally Prime

# 🛡️ Remote Access Infrastructure for Tally & SMB over OpenVPN

## 📌 Project Overview

This project showcases the design and deployment of a secure, bidirectional remote access system using **OpenVPN**, **Windows SMB file sharing**, and **Tally Prime license server routing**. The goal was to enable a remote user (my brother) to access my home PC’s shared folders and Tally license server from a different city (200+ km away) over a VPN tunnel, with full authentication, file transfer, and application-level access.

## 🔧 Key Components

### ✅ VPN Configuration
- Protocol: **TCP** (for reliable file transfer)
- Subnet: `10.8.0.0/24`
- MTU Optimization: `tun-mtu 1400`, `mssfix 1360`
- Static IP assignment for consistent routing

### ✅ SMB File Sharing
- Created a **dedicated Windows user** (`vpnuser`) with read/write access
- Shared folders configured for authenticated access
- Mapped network drives from a remote PC using credentials

### ✅ Tally License Server Access
- Configured `TallyGatewayServer.ini`:
  ```ini
  ServerPort=10000
  ServerBind=0.0.0.0

- Allowed port 10000 in Windows Firewall
- Verified license fetch over VPN (pending final success)

### ✅ Routing & Firewall
Static route added:
- Destination: 192.168.1.0
- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
- Gateway: 10.8.0.14
- Firewall rules scoped to allow traffic from 10.8.0.0/24

## 🧪 Troubleshooting Journey
### 🔍 SMB Transfer Failure
- Initial file transfers failed with “socket closed” errors
- Diagnosed short-lived SMB sessions via Event Viewer
    ![Refer to logs](screenshots/eventLogs.png)

### 🔍 Guest Account Limitations
- Identified that Guest account caused premature session termination
- Created vpnuser with full access to resolve

### 🔍 VPN Protocol Optimization
- Switched from UDP to TCP to stabilize large file transfers
- Resulted in successful media file transfer and playback

### 🔍 Routing Failures
- Static route initially misconfigured with subnet as gateway
- Corrected to use 10.8.0.14 (brother’s VPN IP)
- Enabled IP forwarding on remote PC to allow LAN-to-LAN routing

## ✅ Current Status
| Component                | Status       | Notes                                                       |
|--------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| VPN Tunnel               | ✅ Working   | TCP-based, stable across geographic distance                |
| SMB Access (Mobile)      | ✅ Working   | Successful via mobile file manager with credentials         |
| SMB Access (Remote PC)   | ✅ Working   | Mapping fails due to Windows credential handling            |
| Tally License Access     | ❌ Pending   | Port 10000 reachable, but license fetch not working         |
| Routing to Remote LAN    | ✅ Working   | Static route + IP forwarding enabled                        |
